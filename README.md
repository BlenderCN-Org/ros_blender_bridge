# Welcome to ROS Blender Bridge!
===
This package is a ROS driver for Blender. It provides access to a Blender armature in ROS, allows you to generate [JointTrajectory](http://docs.ros.org/indigo/api/trajectory_msgs/html/msg/JointTrajectory.html) messages from [Actions](http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:2.6/Manual/Animation/Basics/Actions) stored in Blender .blend files and includes a joint controller for targeting robot body parts at objects in the robots environment (e.g. to make a robot gaze at something).
