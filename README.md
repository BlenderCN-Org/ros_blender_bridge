Welcome to ROS Blender Bridge!
===
ROS Blender Bridge is a ROS driver for Blender. It provides access to Blender armatures in ROS, allows you to run Blender produced animations on ROS based robots and enables you to use Blender's inverse kinematics system to target robot body parts at objects in the robots environment (e.g. to make a robot gaze at something).
