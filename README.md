Welcome to ROS Blender Bridge!
===
ROS Blender Bridge is a ROS driver for Blender. It provides access to Blender armatures in ROS, allows you to run Blender produced animations on ROS based robots and enables you to use Blender's inverse kinematics system to target robot body parts at objects in the robots environment (e.g. to make a robot gaze at something).

# Tutorials
We've created a set of a set of tutorials to help you get started with ROS Blender Bridge. It is assumed that you already have ROS installed and have setup a catkin workspace. If you have not installed ROS [click here](http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu) and if you have not setup a catkin workspace [click here](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace).
